# Goal
* Write a script that processes the sales data (images in .TIF and descriptions in .txt format)
* Generate a PDF sales report and send it to the user
* Write a script to check the health of the system every 60 seconds (cron job). Alert the user if there's any issues.

# What I learn from this
