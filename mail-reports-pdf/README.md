# Problem statement
Your company generated a sales report from a SaaS application in a JSON format and needs you to email this report in a nice PDF format. 

# Goal
* Email reports with an attached PDF
* The attached PDF file must contain all the sales made, the car which made the most revenue, the car that had the most sales, and the most popular sales year.

# What I learn from this
* How to use the email and reportlab modules
* How to make graphical tables and pie charts in PDF
* How to send reports via email using SMTP and TLS

# Output 
## Practice with fruit inventory
